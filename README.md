# Introduction
#### There are 4 containers named (Top, Right, Bottom, Left). You can add any `Actor` to the `Container`, such as `weapons`, `potions`, `skills`, `Ammo`, It uses an `Event-Driven` architecture, so you don't need to extend any `parent class` or `interface`, you just need to add a `component` to your `Actor`

# CT_Cmpt_QuickSlot_Item
#### You only need to add this component to your Actor and listen to these main events as needed.

### `Activation Tags`
#### Sometimes you want an Actor to only work in certain situations, like shield only working with sword, arrow only working with bow, or some skills only working with a specific weapon. Activation Tags are very useful in this case.
#### If you have a skill that can only be activated when you equipped sword and shield , you can configure it like this
