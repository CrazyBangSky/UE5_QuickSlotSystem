# Quick Slot System (Coming Soon)
### This `Component` has two forms ( `Soul Like` and `General RPG Like` ) , The good news is that they are just differences in UI presentation, and you donâ€™t need any coding

# Introduction
#### There are 4 containers named (Top, Right, Bottom, Left). You can add any `Actor` to the `Container`, such as `weapons`, `potions`, `skills`, It uses an `Event-Driven` architecture, so you don't need to extend any `parent class` or `interface`, you just need to add a `component` to `your Actor`

### Implement your logic by Listening to these events
| ArrayName| Map Value |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `Event On Added` |  `When current Actor is added to slot (You can do some initialization logic)` 
| `Event On Removed` |  `When current Actor is removed from slot (You can do something like destroy this Actor)` 
| `Event On Used` |  `When current Actor is selected (If it's a weapon, you can Attach it to Hand)` 
| `Event On UnUsed` |  `When current Actor is deselected (If it's a weapon, you can Attach it to Body)` 
| `Event On Triggered` | `When trying to use the current slot (For example, drink potion)`
