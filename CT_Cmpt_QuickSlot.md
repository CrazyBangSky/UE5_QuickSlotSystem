## The confusing part: `Index` is activated list index And `Array Index` is the real index
#### For Exampleï¼šLeftSlots = [Shield, Arrow1, Arrow2, Arrow3], If current weapon is Bow, only Arrows activated
#### Index1 = [Arrow1, Arrow2, Arrow3].get(1) = Arrow2
#### RealIndex1 = [Shield, Arrow1, Arrow2, Arrow3].get(1) = Arrow1
